# Module 1: Hello World

### What's Covered?
- File naming
- Printing
- Types of comments

### Effective File Naming
All of your projects should be stored inside folders. No matter what, good organization is key. Any naming should __NOT__ contain spaces or random symbols. They should be structured and be connected with `_`.
```
YourName_ProjectName_Date

GOOD EXAMPLES:
Jackson_DiscordBot_GameStats_June2023
Ethan_HTMLwebsite_Portfolio_May2022
Conner_PythonTutorial_September2023

BAD EXAMPLES:
untitled project 789543
discord bot
website
```

### Priting
Pritning is the most crucial concept in a program, because that is how you can see *what* is going on in the program. You can print by typing `print()`, then put your message in the `()`'s. Later we will discuss different types of data you can print. For now, words go in quotations, `""`, and numbers go in without anything else.  
Examples:
```
print("Hello World!")     ## Hello World!
print('How are you?')     ## How are you?
print(12)                 ## 12
```

### Comments
Comments are essential for any program, to keep notes, set markers, and unuse code snippets. There are two ways to make comments in Python. You can do single line comments with a `#`, or several line comments with `"""`.  
Examples:
```
# This program will print 'Hello World'


"""
I love
Keeping
Track
Of My
Comments!
"""

# Dont use:
# print("Yooooo")
```

## Overall Example
File Name: `module1basics.py`
```
"""
This project is going to print a few lines explaining how cool python is!
Like it is REALLY REALLY cool.
"""

print("Python is okay...") # Not true
# Switch it up
print("haha just kidding, python is:")
print("SUPER SUPER SUPER COOL!!!!!")
```
Output:  
> Python is okay...
> haha just kidding, python is:
> SUPER SUPER SUPER COOL!!!!!
