# Module 1: Hello World

### What's Covered?
- File naming
- Printing
- Types of comments

### Effective File Naming
All of your projects should be stored inside folders. No matter what, good organization is key. Any naming should __NOT__ contain spaces or random symbols. They should be structured and be connected with `_`.
```
YourName_ProjectName_Date

GOOD EXAMPLES:
Jackson_DiscordBot_GameStats_June2023
Ethan_HTMLwebsite_Portfolio_May2022
Conner_PythonTutorial_September2023

BAD EXAMPLES:
untitled project 789543
discord bot
website
```

### Priting
Pritning is the most crucial concept in a program, because that is how you can see *what* is going on in the program. You can print by typing `print()`, then put your message in the `()`'s. Later we will discuss different types of data you can print. For now, words go in quotations, `""`, and numbers go in without anything else.  
Examples:
```
print("Hello World!")     ## Hello World!
print('How are you?')     ## How are you?
print(12)                 ## 12
```
