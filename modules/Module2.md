# Module 2: Variables / Data
### What's Covered?
- Creating variables
- Types of variables
- Changing types
- Printing
- Editing variables

### Creating Variables
In python, creating variables are pretty straight forward.  
  
What is on the __left__ of the `=` will be the variable name.  
What is on the __right__ of the `=` will be what is stored inside the variable.

For example, you want to name a variable `x`, and store the number `8` inside of it. You would do `x = 8`.  

**Python Variable Naming Rules:**
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

### Types of Variables
There are different types of variables meant to store different types of data.
- Numbers
  - Integers (1, 2, 3) --> int()
  - Floats (1.0, 2.0, 3.25) --> float()
- Text
  - Strings ("Hello!", "(598dshfkweq)", "Pyth0n ru13z") --> str()
- Lists ([1, 2, 3], ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]) --> list()
- Tuples ("Apple", "Banana"), ("Cheese", "Pizza") (1, 3, 5) --> tuple()

### Variables in use
```
integerVar = 28
floatVar = 4.0
stringVar = "Hello World!"
listVar = [1, 2, 3]
tupleVar = (1, 2, 3)
```

### Changing Types
To an extent, you can change different variable types. Like converting an int to a string, or an int to a float.
