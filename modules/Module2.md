### Creating Variables
In python, creating variables are pretty straight forward.  
  
What is on the __left__ of the `=` will be the variable name.  
What is on the __right__ of the `=` will be what is stored inside the variable.

For example, you want to name a variable `x`, and store the number `8` inside of it. You would do `x = 8`.  

**Python Variable Naming Rules:**
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
