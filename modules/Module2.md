### Creating Variables
In python, creating variables are pretty straight forward.  
  
What is on the __left__ of the `=` will be the variable name.  
What is on the __right__ of the `=` will be what is stored inside the variable.

For example, you want to name a variable `x`, and store the number `8` inside of it. You would do `x = 8`.
