### Creating Functions
You can create a function by declarding it using `def`, then the function name, followed by any parameters you will need.  
Here is an example for making a basic function:
```
def myFunctionName():
    # Function Code
```

Python uses **white space** insead of curly braces like other languages use. After a functon or conditional that uses several lines, you will add a `:` to the end of your top line, then every line below you want to use, add an `indent`.
